                <h3>Shane Whitmore</h3>

                <p>Shane Whitmore is an applied computing Internet of Things student at the South East Technology University Waterford. This project was heavily inspired by the 
                    Artificial intelligence "J.A.R.V.I.S" from The Marvel Cinematic Universe. The idea of an intelligence system capable of mantaining and managing a house was really interesting.
                </p>

                <p>Other projects that Shane has worked on include the following three items; a smart doorbell called 'The iSpy', a turbidity sensor that sends json data via MQTT and a jewellery store inventory managing system 
                    all of which can be found in the github link below.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When Shane completes his Bachelors degree in Internet of Things he would like to study a Masters degree in Artifical intelligence to further develope "D.I.N.A".

                <p>"I have always been interested in technology from a young age. One of the most memorable moments for me was when my father pulled the PlayStation 2 from the attic and set it up in the living room for me.
                    I was amazed at how a car could fit on to my television screen and how I could drive it at the age of seven. In 2019 I got my first summer job and saved up my money and bought the parts to build my own computer, 
                    I spent hours at the kitchen table absolutly mesmerized at every little detail on the componants and the second my computer booted up
                    , I knew I needed to persue a career in technology".
